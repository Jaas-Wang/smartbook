# Concluding Thoughts

# 总结思考

Congratulations! You've made it! If you have worked through all of the notebooks to this point, then you have joined the small, but growing group of people that are able to harness the power of deep learning to solve real problems. You may not feel that way yet—in fact you probably don't. We have seen again and again that students that complete the fast.ai courses dramatically underestimate how effective they are as deep learning practitioners. We've also seen that these people are often underestimated by others with a classic academic background. So if you are to rise above your own expectations and the expectations of others, what you do next, after closing this book, is even more important than what you've done to get to this point.

恭喜！你已经完成它了！如果你学习完了所有的章节到了这里，那么你已经加入了很小但正在成长的群体，他们能够利用深度学习的知识解决实际问题。你可能还没有感觉到，实际上你也能没有这种感觉。我们已经一次又一次的看到学完 fast.ai 课程的学生们戏剧性的理解了，他们如何有效的做一名深度学习行业人员。我们也见到过那些人经常被具有典型学院北京的那些人所低估。所以如果你要超越你自己预期或其他人的期望，合上本书后，你接下来要做的事情甚至比你已经到达这一点更重要。

The most important thing is to keep the momentum going. In fact, as you know from your study of optimizers, momentum is something that can build upon itself! So think about what you can do now to maintain and accelerate your deep learning journey. <do_next> can give you a few ideas.

最重要的事情是保持这一势头。事实上，从你的优化器的学习中你应该知道，动力是能够建立于它自己之上的东西！所以思考一下你现在能够做的事情来维持和加速你的深度学习旅程。图<下一步工作>能够给你一些建议。

We've talked a lot in this book about the value of writing, whether it be code or prose. But perhaps you haven't quite written as much as you had hoped so far. That's okay! Now is a great chance to turn that around. You have a lot to say, at this point. Perhaps you have tried some experiments on a dataset that other people don't seem to have looked at in quite the same way. Tell the world about it! Or perhaps thinking about trying out some ideas that occurred to you while you were reading—now is a great time to turn those ideas into code.

在本书我们已经谈论了很多编写的价值，不论是代码，或是诗歌。但也许你目前为止还没有完全编写出你所希望的代码。这没有什么关系！现在是扭转这一局面的绝佳时机。在这一点，你会有很多要说的。也许你已经尝试了没有像其它人那样以完全相同的方法看待的数据集实验。那就把它告诉这个世界！或者也许在学习本书期间你考虑实现一些点子，现在是把那些点子转换为代码的最好时机。

If you'd like to share your ideas, one fairly low-key place to do so is the [fast.ai forums](https://forums.fast.ai/). You will find that the community there is very supportive and helpful, so please do drop by and let us know what you've been up to. Or see if you can answer a few questions for those folks who are earlier in their journey than you.

如果你喜欢分享你的想法，一个相当低调的地方来做这个事情那就是 [fast.ai](https://forums.fast.ai/) 论坛。你将发现这个团体是非常乐于助人的，请一定要来并让我们知道你做了什么。或看是否你能够解答一些比你更早加入深度学习旅程的那些人的问题。

And if you do have some successes, big or small, in your deep learning journey, be sure to let us know! It's especially helpful if you post about them on the forums, because learning about the successes of other students can be extremely motivating.

并且如果你在深度学习的旅程中有一些成功经验，不论大小，一定让我们知道！如果你把这些内容发布在论坛上那是尤为有益的，因为学习其它同学的成功经验能够有异常的激励作用。

Perhaps the most important approach for many people to stay connected with their learning journey is to build a community around it. For instance, you could try to set up a small deep learning meetup in your local neighborhood, or a study group, or even offer to do a talk at a local meetup about what you've learned so far or some particular aspect that interested you. It's okay that you are not the world's leading expert just yet—the important thing to remember is that you now know about plenty of stuff that other people don't, so they are very likely to appreciate your perspective.

也许对于很多人来说与他们的学习旅程保持联系的最重要的方法是围绕它建立一个社区。你可以在你当地社区尝试建立一个小的深度学习见面会，或一个研究小组，或者在一个当地的见面上做一个截至目前你已经学到内容的交流，或你特别感兴趣的部分。你暂时还不是这个世界上顶尖专家这没有什么关系，请记住一个重要的事情，那就是你现在知道大量其它人不知道的东西，所以他们可能非常欣赏你的观点。

Another community event which many people find useful is a regular book club or paper reading club. You might find that there are some in your neighbourhood already, and if not you could try to get one started yourself. Even if there is just one other person doing it with you, it will help give you the support and encouragement to get going.

很多人发现有帮助的另外一个社区活动是定期的书友俱乐部或论文阅读俱乐部。你可能发现在你的社区已经有一些这样的活动了，如果没有你可以尝试开启一个你自己的。即使只有另外一个人与你做这个事情，它将有助于给你提供支持和鼓励出发。

If you are not in a geography where it's easy to get together with like-minded folks in person, drop by the forums, because there are always people starting up virtual study groups. These generally involve a bunch of folks getting together over video chat once a week or so to discuss some deep learning topic.

如果你自身不是在一个容易聚集具有相同目的伙伴的地方，那就拜访一下论坛，因为在那里总有人发起虚拟学习小组。通常这群参于的人一星期在视频聊天工具上聚在一起一次或这样讨论一些深度学习的话题。

Hopefully, by this point, you have a few little projects that you've put together and experiments that you've run. Our recommendation for the next step is to pick one of these and make it as good as you can. Really polish it up into the best piece of work that you can—something you are really proud of. This will force you to go much deeper into a topic, which will really test your understanding and give you the opportunity to see what you can do when you really put your mind to it.

希望通过本书你有了一些组合在一起和你已经运行的实验的小项目。我们建议下一步从中挑选一个，并尽你所能做它。把它实际打磨到你所能做到的最佳成果，真正你引以为豪的东西。它会迫使你到更深入的探讨一个主题，它将真正测试你的理解力，并当你真正用心去做的时候，它会给你看清你能够做什么的机会

Also, you may want to take a look at the fast.ai free online course that covers the same material as this book. Sometimes, seeing the same material in two different ways can really help to crystallize the ideas. In fact, human learning researchers have found that one of the best ways to learn material is to see the same thing from different angles, described in different ways.

同样，你可能希望看一下 fast.ai 的免费在线教程，它覆盖了本书的同样内容。有时候以不同的方式看一下相同的内容，能够真正的帮助把想法具体化。实际上，人类学习研究员已经发现了学习东西最好的方法之一是从不同的角度看相同的事物，以不同的方法描述。

Your final mission, should you choose to accept it, is to take this book and give it to somebody that you know—and get somebody else started on their own deep learning journey!

如果你选择接受这个任务的话，那你最后的任务是把这本书推荐给你所认识的人，并让其它人开启他们自己的深度学习之旅！
